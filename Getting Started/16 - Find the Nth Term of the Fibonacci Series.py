# Find the Fibonacci Series up to Nth Term.
# Given an integer as an input, the objective is to find the Fibonacci series until the number input as the Nth term.
# Therefore, we write a program to Find the Fibonacci Series up to Nth Term.

# Example
# Input : 4
# Output : 0 1 1 2

num = int(input("Give input = "))

print((num-1)+(num-2))

print((num*2)-3)
