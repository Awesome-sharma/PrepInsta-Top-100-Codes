# Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not
# Given an integer input year, the objective of the code is to Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not in Python Language. To do so  weâ€™ll check if the year input satisfies either of the two conditions of leap year.

# Example
# Input : 2020
# Output : It's a Leap Year.

year = int(input("give year = "))

if (year%400==0):
  print(year,"is a leap year")
elif(year%100 != 0 and year%4==0):
  print(year,"is a leap year")
else:
  print(year,"is not a leap year")
